# Structured Concurrency in C++

Structured concurrency is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by using a structured approach to concurrent programming. It ensures that child operations are guaranteed to complete before their parent operations, simplifying error handling, cancellation, and resource management. In structured concurrency, related tasks running in different threads are treated as a single unit of work.
